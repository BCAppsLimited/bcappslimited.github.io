# What is Bank Validator?

OK, this is probably not going to come as a shock, but the Bank Validator is for validating bank account numbers. Specifically New Zealand and Australian bank account numbers. It adds an immediate visual feedback to every page that contains a **Bank Branch No.** and **Bank Account Number** field. Namely:

- **Bank Account Card**
- **Vendor Bank Account Card**
- **Customer Bank Account Card**
- **Employee Card**

In addition to the displays on the setup cards, the **Payment Journal** will show a warning if the bank account number used on the related account is not in a valid New Zealand or Australian bank account number format.

We don't alter the data and we don't stop you from using the bank account if it's not valid, however, the **Bank Account Validation Result** field that has been added to each of the previously listed pages shows a big bright friendly green tick if the entered number is valid according to the validation rule that has been selected.

# How Much?

## Unlimited Free Trial in Sandbox

This extension is fully featured and completely free to use in a sandbox environment, so you can install the extension and try it out without paying a cent. Use it for as long as you like in your sandbox environments.

## Limited Free Trial in Production

It seems too good to be true, but if you decide to go ahead with our extension in your Production environment, you will get *another* free trial. You will need to purchase and assign licenses to your users, but you will not be charged for the first thirty days of use, and when your subscription does start to appear on your bill, you can cancel at any time. All licenses are managed through your Microsoft 365 Admin center and billed directly to you as part of your regular Microsoft Invoice (or can be bought using a credit card if you prefer).
