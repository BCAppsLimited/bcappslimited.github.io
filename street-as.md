# What is Street As?

Street As changes the layout of all[^1] pages that include address fields so they are better suited for New Zealand addresses. Once activated, all address pages will show:

- **Address**
- **Suburb**
- **Town or City**
- **Postcode**

The **Country/Region** code that controls how an address is displayed has also moved so that it appears before the first address field. You can configure the system so that leaving the **Country/Region** field empty will treat the address like it's a New Zealand address.

# How Much?

Street As is available from Microsoft's AppSource marketplace and can be installed by any administrator of Business Central that also has the ability to configure licenses for Microsoft 365 Apps. The app has a very low per-user license price that is bill directly to you through your existing Microsoft account. The first month will be completely free allowing you to try the app and cancel before the first billing period starts. You can even start your free trial without selecting the option to automatically renew (meaning it will cancel as soon as the free trial has finished[^2]).
